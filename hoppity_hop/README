Output specifications
 
The program should iterate over all integers (inclusive) from 1 to the number expressed by the input file. 

For example, if the file contained the number 10, the submission should iterate over 1 through 10. At each integer value in this range, the program may possibly (based upon the following rules) output a single string terminating with a newline. 
 
For integers that are evenly divisible by three, output the exact string Hoppity, followed by a newline.

For integers that are evenly divisible by five, output the exact string Hophop, followed by a newline.

For integers that are evenly divisble by both three and five, do not do any of the above, but instead output the exact string Hop, followed by a newline.
